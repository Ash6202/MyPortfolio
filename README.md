## 📂 **Projects**  
### 🔹 **Next-Gen Propulsion Strategy and Energy Analysis – GE Aerospace (Forage)**  
- Completed a job simulation where I advised on alternative energy sources for
 a hypothetical Aerospace team at GE.
- Analyzed and compared diverse energy sources for propulsion systems,
 including cost, energy density, storage requirements, and how they impact
 design decisions.
- Conducted in-depth research on bypass ratio and compression ratio and their
 impact on turbofan engine design, including fan diameter, noise, installation
 considerations, material limitations, and emissions implications.
- Developed a technical presentation to effectively communicate the limiting
 factors associated with bypass and compression ratios that helped guide the
 decision-making for a next-generation propulsion system at GE Aerospace.

### 🔹 **Development of a Mobile Application for Cable Inspection Using YOLO Based Image Detection** 
- Successfully trained a YOLOv5 model for cable fault detection using a custom dataset annotated via Roboflow which reached mAP@0.5 of 93%.  
- Converted the trained model into TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for mobile deployment and optimized for performance using techniques like quantization.
- Built a working mobile app using Flutter Software.

### 🔹 **Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning** 
- Built a logistic regression model to classify red wines as "Good" or "Bad" based on chemical properties.
- Improved classification accuracy from 71.5% to 73% through data cleaning, outlier handling, and feature scaling.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand feature distributions and detect outliers.
- Performed correlation analysis to identify key predictors such as alcohol content and volatile acidity.
- Transformed multi-class labels into binary classes to streamline model performance and interpretation.
- Applied StandardScaler to normalize features, ensuring consistent contribution across all variables.
- Demonstrated practical value for wine producers by enabling automated, objective, and scalable quality assessment.

### 🔹 **Autonomous Line Following and Obstacle Avoidance Robot**
- Designed and built a mobile robot using Arduino that follows a line and avoids obstacles using infrared and ultrasonic sensors.
- Programmed real-time decision-making logic enabling the robot to dynamically adjust movement based on sensor inputs.
- Implemented obstacle avoidance feature using ultrasonic distance sensing and a custom turn-around routine.
- Achieved seamless integration between hardware (motors, sensors, motor driver) and software control logic via Arduino IDE.
- Enhanced system robustness by modularizing code with functions such as turnAround() for improved readability and reusability.
- Gained hands-on experience in PWM motor control, sensor calibration, and autonomous navigation techniques.
- Strengthened understanding of core robotics concepts including sensor fusion, feedback loops, and embedded system design.
